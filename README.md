🔍 Legends of Xibalba - A Mayan Text-Based RPG

Legends of Xibalba is a text-based role-playing game (RPG) rooted in ancient Mayan mythology. Inspired by the Popol Vuh, players take on the role of a living hero journeying through the trials of Xibalba, the Mayan underworld. But the story is told by the god of death himself—Vucub-Came—not as a villain, but as a forgotten guardian of balance.

🌄 Setting

Before the maize, before the sun, there was silence. Xibalba was sacred, and death was a passage, not a punishment. Through the eyes of Vucub-Came, the trials that await the player are not cruel traps, but sacred rites meant to prepare the soul for transformation. As the world forgets these truths, you walk the old path once more.
