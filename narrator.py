They call me death. But I am not your enemy.
I am the silence between heartbeats. The breath before dawn.
Before you were born, I knew your name. And I have prepared your trials
not to destroy you... but to reveal you.

You walk into my world nowâ€”into the caves where the sky does not reach.
You seek glory, or peace, or the memory of your ancestors.
But here, all things are stripped away.

Only truth remains.

Welcome, hero. Welcome to Xibalba.
